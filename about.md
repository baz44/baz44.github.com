Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Basel Farah and I am an experienced software engineer with over 16 years of experience in the field.

I have a passion for developing elegant and efficient software solutions that solve complex problems. Throughout my career, I have worked with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Clojure, Ruby on Rails, Java, and many others. My experience in these different languages has given me a broad perspective on software engineering that allows me to quickly adapt to new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.

Over the years, I have honed my skills in software architecture, design patterns, and best practices, and have become an expert in agile development methodologies. I have worked on projects of all sizes, from small startups to large enterprise-level applications, and have a proven track record of delivering high-quality software solutions that meet the needs of my clients and end-users.

When I'm not working on software projects, I enjoy staying active and spending time with my family. I am an avid runner and enjoy playing the violin and piano. I also love to travel and explore new cultures, and am always looking for my next adventure.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you!
